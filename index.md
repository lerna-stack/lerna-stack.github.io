- By executing Lerna's scripts to VMs running on the cloud (public or private), you can build an environment that is configured to achieve high availability and high throughput.
- In that environment, designing and implementing applications based on the actor model ([Akka](https://akka.io/)) and CQRS(Command Query Responsibility Segregation) with Event Sourcing architecture allows you to build highly available systems.
- Libraries and reference implementations for design and implementation are provided.

## Concept

### High availability and high throughput

- Eliminates the bottleneck of writing to the RDBMS by applying the CQRS with Event Sourcing architecture to the application layer
- High Availability and Scalability with Akka Cluster
- Provides responsiveness by making the application stateful, while providing fast failover with guaranteed consistency using Raft

### Platform independent

- Fast failover at the middleware and application layers with platform independence, based on the premise that the server (VM) will stop.
- This ensures high availability independent of hardware and specific cloud environments


### Low cost and fast delivery

- No need to purchase expensive high-availability servers; high availability can be achieved at low cost by using OSS middleware.
- Because it can be built on the cloud, it reduces the lead time for hardware procurement and improves delivery speed.
